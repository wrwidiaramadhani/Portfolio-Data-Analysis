# Cars Retail Analysis 
## Project Workflow
### 1. Create Database, Table, and Insert Data
The dataset already exists from the course I'm taking. In this step, I'll insert the existing PGSQL data into the prepared table.
### 2. Final Dataset Table
There are several tables that are needed and created in the case of cars retail. These are some tables used in car retail cases, including:
- customers table
- employees table
- offices table
- orderdetails table
- orders table
- payments table
- productlines table
- products table
### 3. Understanding The Case Requested 
Once the tables have been created and the data entered, the next step is to understand the case study based on the client's request. This case understanding includes:
- what information/output the client desires,
- the purpose of the data analysis,
- understanding which tables and columns will be used to generate the required information or output.
- Note:
This client request is a case study provided by the course/bootcamp I attended.
### 4. Data Exploration
After understanding the case study, this is the core of the data analysis activity in this case. The next step is to explore the database and tables in the car retailer to display information in tabular form based on the client's request.
